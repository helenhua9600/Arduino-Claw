# Arduino Claw
> **Note** 
> code is private and is available upon request

As a group of 6, we designed, constructed, and programmed a fully autonomous Claw Retrieval System that can pick up various designated objects at specified locations. The project combines computer programming with an Arduino-compatible microcontroller device that interfaces with a sonar sensor and servo motor. The final product must dangle from a string and be capable of autonomously grabbing objects without the user opening and closing the claw.

## Skills developed
* hands-on skills while working with physical prototyping to construct our claw
* experience with programming microcontrollers to control the claw
* understanding and practice of the engineering design cycle
* prototyping, testing and usage of WDMs (weighted decision matrix)
* formal engineering design drawings 

## C-sketches
We first brainstormed ideas through several rounds of C-sketches. C sketches are when each member sketches a design concept, then passes it along to another member to modify silently. The C-sketch process ends once the sketch returns to the original designer.

## Screening and scoring
We first made a [Risk register](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1B13j_zogONO7DWGVL-Loy0cqt1PtNvaB/view?usp=share_link), then brainstormed ways to reduce the risk

Then made several basic cardboard prototypes screened out used several ideas that didn't meet the specifications and needs of stakeholders

We then combined several c-sketch ideas together and used a WDM (weighted decision matrix) to score the remaining 2 ideas

<b> Test: Prototype Item Grabbing Test</b>

After screening and scoring prototypes, we were left with 2 final claw designs. We did one final test on the claws to optimize their designs to grab various sized and weighted objects.

The code for the project utilizes an Arduino Uno board, sonar and server motor to recognize a surface, open its claw up until the item is secured, then closes.
